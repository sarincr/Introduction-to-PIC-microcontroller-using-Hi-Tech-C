# Introduction-to-PIC-microcontroller-using-Hi-Tech-C
HI-TECH C Compiler for PIC10/12/16 MCUs - PRO fully implements the optimizations of Omniscient Code Generationâ„¢ - a whole-program compilation technology - to provide denser code and better performance on PIC MCUs. This ANSI C compiler integrates into Microchips MPLAB(R) IDE and is compatible with Microchip debuggers and emulators. PIC16(L)F1885X/7X microcontrollers feature Analog, Core Independent Peripherals and communication peripherals, combined with eXtreme Low Power (XLP) for a wide range of general purpose and low-power applications. The family features the CRC/SCAN, HLT and Windowed WDT to support customers looking to add safety to their application. Additionally, this family includes up to 56 KB of Flash memory, along with a 10-bit ADC with Computation (ADC2) for automated signal analysis to reduce the complexity of the application.
